Boulder break is a 2-dimensional puzzle game where the goal is to help an adventurer collect treasure and escape from a cave by pushing boulders into holes that may block the exit. 

To collect treasure, the adventurer simply needs to move onto its location.

To push a boulder, the adventurer must position themselves next to the boulder and can only push the boulder in the direction of their movement. When the adventurer pushes a boulder, the boulder will continue to roll in a straight line until it hits an obstacle (either part of the cave, a treasure chest or another boulder). The position of the adventurer does not change when they
push a boulder. After the boulder has moved, the adventurer can move.

To escape the cave, the adventurer must move onto the exit. If the exit is blocked by a hole, they must push a boulder into the hole which will fill it in, allowing them to access the exit.

If the adventurer steps onto a hole, they will fall in and meet an untimely end. That will be the
end of the game.
